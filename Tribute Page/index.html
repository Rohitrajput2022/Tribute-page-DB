                Dhirubhai Hirachand Ambani popularly known as Dhirubhai Ambani. Was Born on 28 December 1932 in
                Chorwad, Malia Taluka, Junagadh district, Gujarat. <br><br>
                Dhirubhai Ambani was Indian business tycoon who founded Reliance Industries in 1966. And took Reliance
                public in 1977. <br><br>
                Dhirubhai Ambani was was honoured posthumously with the Padma Vibhushan, India's second-highest civilian
                honour for his contributions to trade and industry. <br><br>
                He left Aden in 1958 to try his hand at his own business in India in the textiles market. <br><br>
                Ambani returned to India and started "Majin" in partnership with Champaklal Damani, his second cousin,
                who lived with him in Yemen. Majin was to import polyester yarn and export spices to Yemen. <br><br>
                The first office of the Reliance Commercial Corporation was set up at the Narsinatha Street in Masjid
                Bunder. <br><br>
                During this period, Ambani and his family stayed in a two-bedroom apartment at the Jai Hind Estate in
                Bhuleshwar, Mumbai. <br><br>
                In 1965, Champaklal Damani and Dhirubhai Ambani ended their partnership and Ambani started on his own.
                It is believed
                that both had different temperaments and different takes on how to conduct business. While Damani was a
                cautious
                trader and did not believe in building yarn inventories, Ambani was a known risk-taker and believed in
                building
                inventories to increase profit. <br><br>
                In 1966 he formed Reliance Commercial Corporation which later became Reliance Industries on 8 May 1973.
                <br><br>
                Ambani was admitted to the Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai on 24 June 2002 after he suffered a major
                stroke. It was his
                second stroke, the first had occurred in February 1986 and had paralyzed his right hand. He was in a
                coma for more than
                a week and a number of doctors were consulted. He died on 6 July 2002. <br><br>
                The country has lost iconic proof of what an ordinary Indian fired by the spirit of enterprise and
                driven by
                determination can achieve in his own lifetime. -by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, former Prime Minister of India
